# TypeScript

wagmi is written in TypeScript so the library and your projects are type-safe! Things to keep in mind:

- Types currently require using TypeScript v4.7.4 or greater.
- Changes to types in this repository are considered non-breaking and are usually released as patch semver changes (otherwise every type enhancement would be a major version!).
- It is highly recommended that you lock your `wagmi` package version to a specific patch release and upgrade with the expectation that types may be fixed or upgraded between any release.
- The non-type-related public API of wagmi still follows semver very strictly.

## Type Inference

Types in wagmi generally don't require providing type annotations for yourself. For contract interaction hooks and signing typed data, you must add [const assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html#const-assertions) to `contractInterface` and `types` respectively to get the best type inference. For example, `useContractRead`:

```ts
import { useContractRead } from 'wagmi'

const { data } = useContractRead({
  //    ^? (property) data: BigNumber | undefined
  addressOrName: '0xecb504d39723b0be0e3a9aa33d646642d1051ee1',
  contractInterface: [
    {
      name: 'getUncleanliness',
      inputs: [],
      outputs: [{ name: '', type: 'uint256' }],
      stateMutability: 'view',
      type: 'function',
    },
    {
      name: 'love',
      inputs: [{ name: '', type: 'address' }],
      outputs: [{ name: '', type: 'uint256' }],
      stateMutability: 'view',
      type: 'function',
    },
    {
      name: 'play',
      inputs: [],
      outputs: [],
      stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
      type: 'function',
    },
  ] as const,
  functionName: 'love',
  // ^? (property) functionName: "getUncleanliness" | "love"
  args: ['0x27a69ffba1e939ddcfecc8c7e0f967b872bac65c'],
  // ^? (property) args?: readonly [`0x${string}`] | undefined
})
```
