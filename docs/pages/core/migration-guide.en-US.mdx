# Migration Guide

If you are coming from an earlier version of `@wagmi/core`, you will need to make sure to update the following APIs listed below.

## 0.8.x Breaking changes

### waitForTransaction

#### Behavioral changes

`waitForTransaction` will throw an error if the transaction has been reverted or cancelled.

#### Configuration changes

Removed the `wait` config option on `waitForTransaction`. Use the transaction `hash` instead.

```diff
const { data } = await waitForTransaction({
- wait: transaction.wait
+ hash: transaction.hash
})
```
