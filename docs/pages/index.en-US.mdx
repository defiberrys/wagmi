**wagmi** is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start working with Ethereum. wagmi makes it easy to "Connect Wallet," display ENS and balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts, and much more — all with caching, request deduplication, and persistence.

## Overview

```tsx
import { Provider, createClient, useAccount, useConnect } from 'wagmi'

const client = createClient()

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider client={client}>
      <ConnectWallet />
    </Provider>
  )
}

function Profile() {
  const { data } = useAccount()
  const { connectors, connect } = useConnect()

  if (data?.address) return <div>Connected to {data.address}</div>
  return <button onClick={() => connect(connectors[0])}>Connect Wallet</button>
}
```

In this example, we create a wagmi `Client` (using the default configuration) and pass it to the React Context `Provider`. Then, we use the `useConnect` hook to connect a wallet to the app. Finally, we show the connected account's address using `useAccount`.

The default client is initialized with MetaMask, but connectors for WalletConnect and Coinbase Wallet are also just an import away. `useAccount` can also automatically fetch the ENS name and avatar for the connected account. We've only scratched the surface for what you can do with wagmi!
