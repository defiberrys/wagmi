# Getting Started

## Overview

The setup process and the Solid hooks are very similar to the React package, the most important things to know are:
- Import the modules from `@wagmi/solid` instead of `wagmi`.
- Most of the hooks props expect a signal. If you don't need it to be reactive, you can pass a function that will return your prop.
- Most of the missing documentation here is the exact same as the React package.

## Manual setup

### Installation

Install wagmi and its ethers peer dependency.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
```bash
npm i @wagmi/solid ethers@^5
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
pnpm i @wagmi/solid ethers@^5
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
yarn add @wagmi/solid ethers@^5
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Configure chains

First, configure your desired chains to be used by wagmi, and the providers you want to use.

```tsx
import { configureChains, mainnet, publicProvider } from '@wagmi/solid'

const { chains, provider, webSocketProvider } = configureChains(
  [mainnet],
  [publicProvider()],
)
```

This example uses the Ethereum Mainnet chain (`mainnet`) from `wagmi`, however, you can also pass in any [EVM-compatible chain](/solid/chains).

Note: In a production app, it is not recommended to only pass `publicProvider` to `configureChains` as you will probably face rate-limiting on the public provider endpoints. It is recommended to also pass an [`alchemyProvider`](/react/providers/alchemy) or [`infuraProvider`](/react/providers/infura) as well.

[Read more about configuring chains](/solid/providers/configuring-chains)

### Create a wagmi client

Next, create a wagmi `Client` instance using [`createClient`](/solid/client), and pass the result from `configureChains` to it.

```tsx {9-13}
import { WagmiConfig, createClient, configureChains, mainnet, publicProvider } from '@wagmi/solid'

const { chains, provider, webSocketProvider } = configureChains(
  [mainnet],
  [publicProvider()],
)

const client = createClient({
  autoConnect: true,
  provider,
  webSocketProvider,
})
```

[Read more about client configuration](/solid/client)

### Wrap app with `WagmiConfig`

Finally, wrap your app with the [`WagmiConfig`](/solid/WagmiConfig) component, passing `client` to it.

```tsx {9-11}
const client = createClient({
  autoConnect: true,
  provider,
  webSocketProvider,
})

function App() {
  return (
    <WagmiConfig client={client}>
      <YourRoutes />
    </WagmiConfig>
  )
}
```

### You're good to go!

Use hooks! Every component inside the `WagmiConfig` is now set up to use the wagmi hooks.

```tsx {5,6,7-9}
import { useAccount, useConnect, useEnsName, InjectedConnector } from '@wagmi/solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

function Profile() {
  const [chainId, setChainId] = createSignal(1)
  const accData = useAccount()

  const { connect } = useConnect({
    // reactive (signal)
    chainId
    // not reactive
    // chainId: () => 1
  })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setChainId(5)}>Change chainId to 5</button>
      <button onClick={() => connect()}>Connect Wallet</button>
    </>
  )
}
```
